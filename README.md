## Overview

* This cs533_assignment2.ipynb file contains the implementation of an Information Retrieval System using a combination of TF-IDF, BM25, and Word Embeddings. The system is designed to retrieve relevant documents for a given query from the CISI dataset. 

* For a determined list of set of weight, the cs533_assignment2.ipynb file computes MAP values for each system. Note that for a set of weights (BM25_score_weight, TF-IDF_score_weight, embedding_score_weigh), the written code calculates MAP for both a system using pre-trained Word2Vec model "word2vec-google-news-300" and model trained by CISI dataset.

* After program execution, MAP value for each system along with its information, i.e. weights and which word embedding method used, is written to a file.

## Important Notes

* CISI dataset should be uploaded to Google Drive, if the code is directly used without changing anything.
* Google Drive paths should be updated according to the user Google Drive directory structure

## Setup

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   Ensure that the necessary Python packages are installed by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   !pip install rank-bm25
   !pip install ipython-autotime
   %load_ext autotime

2. Mount your Google Drive and give permission for access. Update CISI dataset paths according to your director structure
